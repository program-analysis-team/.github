## Welcome, friends! 👋

🧙 We are a distributed team of researchers and engineers in the field of automatic program analysis.
The team is dedicated to support software development teams with automatic program analysis tools:

* Source code static analysis (as lightweight linters, as deep program analysis technics including IFDS/IDE + symbolic execution, etc.)
* Binary code static analysis
* Randomized testing of programs and libraries (Fuzzing)
* Dynamic analysis of programs and libraries
* Combined (hybrid) analysis methods
* Automatic exploit generation
etc.

👩‍💻 Purposes of analysis: 
* Metrics calculation
* Performance checking
* Program defects detection
* Test cases generation
* Architecture excavation/discovery
etc.
