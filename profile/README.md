## Welcome 👋

🧙 We are a distributed team of researchers and engineers. The team is created to support software development teams with tools for automatic program analysis:

* Source code static analysis (including IFDS, symbolic execution, etc.)
* Binary code static analysis
* Randomized testing of programs and libraries (Fuzzing)
* Dynamic analysis of programs and libraries
* Automatic exploit generation
etc.

👩‍💻 Purposes of analysis: 
* Metrics calculation
* Performance checking
* Program defects detection
* Test cases generation
* Architecture excavation/discovery
etc.
